In

When

.
The

diminish
.
This
doubt
adds
difficulties

We

The

This

curtails

.
The

Thus

It

This
throws

The

We

How
Overcome
Demonstration
Effect
:
Curtailing
Consumption
Luxury
Goods
:
The
working
demonstration
effect
developing
economies
implies
wants
regulated
curtailed
.
If
wants
people
go
multiplying
influence
demonstration

,
demand
luxuries
non-basic
consumption
goods
increase
.
This
raise
propensity
consume
economy
resulting
low
ratio
saving
income
.
Further
,
increased
wants
luxuries
consumption
divert
basic
resources

,

,

etc.
,
towards
production
.
As
result
,

starved

.
The
use
scarce
national
resources

non-basic
wants
people
millions
live
poverty
line
unable
meet
basic
wants
subsistence
purely
wastage
resources
.
Thus
,
according
Prof.
A.
K.
Dass
Gupta
,
“
The
implication
luxury

underdeveloped

obvious
direct
.
The
underdeveloped
countries
need
high
rate
growth
quite
time
come
.
Their
level
per

income
low
.
In
India
,
example
,
per

income
hardly
adequate

minimum
subsistence
.
Even
stationary

,
country
thus
require
years

accumulation

.
Luxury
consumption
slows

thus
hampers

”
Limitation
Wants
:
Mahatma
Gandhi
warned
long
ago
multiplication
wants
.
He
thus
stated
,
“
I
believe
multiplication

taking

single
step

.
I
whole-heartedly
detest

.
If

civilization
stands
I

,
I
call

It

Mahatma
Gandhi
wrote
.
According
,
end
multiplication

reduce
.
To
quote
,
The
mind

still
remains
unsatisfied
.
Therefore
,
ideal
creating
unlimited

seems

.
Civilization

One
may
entirely
agree

regarding

Now
,
